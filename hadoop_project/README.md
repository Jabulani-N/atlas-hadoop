[Hadoop: Setting up a Single Node Cluster](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)


I installed following [this tutoprial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnrtnFEz22E)

# Run

I begin running with:
1. /mnt/d/Apps/Container/Hadoop/hadoop-3.3.6/`bin/hdfs namenode -format`
2. `sudo service ssh start`
3. `ssh localhost`
4. /mnt/d/Apps/Container/Hadoop/hadoop-3.3.6/`sbin/start-all.sh`

and end with:

1. /mnt/d/Apps/Container/Hadoop/hadoop-3.3.6/sbin/stop-all.sh
    * yours will take place in your own Hadoop directory, so the only part I expect to be the same on your own machine are `/hadoop-3.3.6/sbin/start-all.sh` and `/hadoop-3.3.6/sbin/stop-all.sh`
2. `exit` to close localhost connection
   * it will tell you
        ```
        logout
        Connection to localhost closed.
        ```

# Troubleshooting

Connection Refused

`localhost:9000 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more details see:  http://wition: java.net.ConnectExki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused`

* doublecheck your `hdfs-site.xml` file and be sure it contains

```

<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>dfs.replication</name>
        <value>1</value>
    </property>
</configuration>

```

* be certain you have run
  1. `Address Here/bin/hdfs namenode -format`
  2. `sudo service ssh start`
  3. `ssh localhost`
  4. `Address Here/sbin/start-all.sh`
      * It seems to be a need to do this each login/restart of the machine
      * if you have run the `stop` version, you only need to perform the `start` again, rather than all hte steps before, after they've been run once.

# Python via snakebite

this is docuemtation on some commands you can do. If you are familiar with bash already, you'll recognize functions like `mkdir` and other familiar commands.
https://snakebite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html
* you'll want to ctrl+f through this one for each command you want to see if it gives you a **generator**. If so, you'll have to perform an operation like

        ```
        for item in generator:
            print(item)
        ```

    to "consume" the generator (make it take effect.) You can't have your generator and eat it too. Once consumed, the generator (or item within it) is gone like a slice of cake. You can't un-eat a ~~cake~~ generator. You'll have to make a new one.
